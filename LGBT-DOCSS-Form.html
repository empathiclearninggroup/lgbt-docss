  <div class="intro">
    <h2>The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS)</h2>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Items on this scale are intended to examine clinical preparedness, attitudes, and basic knowledge regarding lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) clients/patients. Please use the provided scale to rate your level of agreement or disagreement for each item.</p>
    <p>Items on this scale primarily inquire about either sexual orientation (LGB = lesbian, gay, and bisexual) or gender identity (transgender). Two questions are inclusive and refer collectively to LGBT clients/patients.</p>
    <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> After completing the scale, your results will include a total mean score and three subscale scores: Clinical Preparedness, Attitudes, and Knowledge. Higher scores indicate greater clinical competence and less prejudice.</p>
